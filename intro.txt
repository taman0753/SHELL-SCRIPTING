Shell scripting is writing a series of command for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script, which can be stored and executed anytime. This reduces the effort required by the end user.

Let us understand the steps in creating a Shell Script

Create a file using a vi editor(or any other editor).  Name  script file with extension .sh
Start the script with #! /bin/sh
Write some code.
Save the script file as filename.sh
For executing the script type bash filename.sh
